            Crafty Metaverse will soon launch Guardians of Lost Worlds, the first cross-chain P2E gaming experience. Our
            game will be available on multiple blockchains and then eventually on our side chain (SANKOFA). This will
            give users a seamless gameplay experience with little to no gas fees that allow users to focus on the game
            rather than worrying about losing their returns.
